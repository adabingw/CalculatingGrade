# CalculatingGrade
There are 3 classes in this program, only 2 of which are needed to run this program. I have included the original code for keepsake and memory (and for a simpler and more straightforward code);
1. running MainCalc() WITH Calculator() creates a program that does not require user input or an interface;
2. running MainCalc() WITH QuestionPane() creates a program that requires user input and has an interface;
